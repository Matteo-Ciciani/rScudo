\title{Create graph from a scudoResults object}
\usage{
scudoNetwork(object, N, colors = character())
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a \code{\linkS4class{scudoResults}} object}

\item{N}{a number between 0 and 1, representing the fraction of the
signature-to-signature distances that will be used to draw the graph}

\item{colors}{a character vector of hexadecimal RGB color codes used to color
the nodes of the graph. \code{length(colors)} must be equal to the number of
samples. By default colors are chosen according to the groups in
\code{object}}
}
\description{
A function to create an \code{\link[igraph:igraph-package]{igraph}} object
from a \code{\linkS4class{scudoResults}} object. In the graph, nodes are
samples and edges quantify the similarity between the nodes.
}
\details{
This function uses the distance matrix in the
\code{\linkS4class{scudoResults}} object to generates an
\code{\link[igraph:igraph-package]{igraph}} object, representing a graph
where nodes are samples and edges quantify the similarity between the
signatures of pairs of nodes.

The distance matrix in \code{object} is used to generate an unweighted
adjacency matrix, that is then used to generate the graph. The sample
quantile of probability N, computed from all the non-zero distances in the
distance matrix, is used as a threshold to generate the adjacency matrix: all
the distances larger than this quantile are mapped to 0, all the distances
smaller than this quantile are mapped to 1 (with the exception of the
distances of any node from itself, which are equal to 0). Distances are set
as attributes of the edges of the graph, and can be retrieved using \code{
igraph::E(igraphObject)$distance}, where \code{igraphObject} is the result
of \code{scudoNetwork}.

The \code{color} parameter controls the color of the nodes. It must be a
vector of hexadecimal RGB color codes (like "#FFFFFF"), with lenth equal to
the number of samples in \code{object}. By default, a different color is
assigned to each group. If no group is specified in \code{object}, all nodes
are set to the same color. A vector of node color can be accessed with \code{
igraph::V(igraphObject)$color}. The group of each node can also be accessed
with \code{igraph::V(igraphObject)$group} (it returns NULL if no group is
specified in \code{object}).

# generate dummy dataset and run scudo
exprData <- data.frame(a = 11:20, b = 16:25,
            c = rev(1:10), d = c(1:2, rev(3:10)))
rownames(exprData) <- letters[11:20]
grps <- as.factor(c("G1", "G1", "G2", "G2"))
nTop <- 2
nBottom <- 3

res <- scudo(exprData, grps, nTop, nBottom, norm = FALSE, featureSel = FALSE)

# generate network and plot it
col <- c("#FF0000", "#FF0000", "#0000FF", "#0000FF")
net <- scudoNetwork(res, N = 0.5, colors = col)
plot(net)
