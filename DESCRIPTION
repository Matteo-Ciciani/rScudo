Description: SCUDO (Signature-based Clustering for Diagnostic Purposes) is a 
    rank-based method for the analysis of gene expression profiles for
    diagnostic and classification purposes. It is based on the identification of
    sample-specific gene signatures composed of the most up- and down-regulated
    genes for that sample. Starting from gene expression data, functions in this
    package identify sample-specific gene signatures and use them to build a
    graph of samples. In this graph samples are joined by edges if they have a
    similar expression profile, according to a pre-computed similarity matrix.
    The similarity between the expression profiles of two samples is computed
    using a method similar to GSEA. The graph of samples can then be used to
    perform community clustering or to perform supervised classification of
    samples in a testing set.
