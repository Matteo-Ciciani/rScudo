Description: SCUDO (Signature-based Clustering for Diagnostic Purposes) is a 
    rank-based method for the analysis of gene expression profiles for
    diagnostic and classification purposes. It is based on the identification of
    sample-specific gene signatures composed of up- and down-regulated genes.
    Starting from gene expression data, functions in this package identify
    sample-specific gene signatures and use them to build a graph of samples,
    that are joined by edges if they have a similar expression profile. The
    similarity between the expression profile of two sample is computed using
    a method similat to GSEA. The graph of samples can the be used to perform
    community clustering or to perform supervised classification of samples
    in a testing set.
