Description: SCUDO is a rank-based method for the analysis of gene expression 
    profiles for diagnostic and classification purposes. It is based on the
    identification of a signature composed of up- and down-regulated genes.
    Starting from gene expression data, it identifies sample-specific gene 
    signatures and uses them to build a graph of samples. Edges are present
    between two nodes if the samples have a similar expression profile. The
    measure of similarity is a metric similar to GSEA. The visualization of the
    grpah is possible both in R and in Cytoscape.
